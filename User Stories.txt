As a student, I want to use the to do list app to enter my activities for the day by organizing tasks with a list, thus making everything much more manageable and makes one feel grounded so that seeing a clear outline of completed and uncompleted tasks will help one feel organized and stay mentally focused.
As a small business owner, I want to use the app to collect feedback thus increasing my clientel and staying in touch with customers.
As a young enthusiastice goal-setter, I want to put things in writing helps in the pursuit of achievement. The 'to do list' will force the goal-setter to examine a task and to reflect on the steps so that, preparation will yield a desired outcome.
